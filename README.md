A simple installer that wraps the kubeadm utility to install a single-node
Kubernetes cluster on CentOS or Ubuntu.

Mostly useful for POC and demos where using minikube isn't possible.

# Prerequisites

**Supported OS**: CentOS 7.x, Ubuntu 16.x 17.x

**Docker**: v1.10, 1.11, 1.12 (recommended)

# Execution

Just run the `installer` script and wait a few minutes until Kubernetes control
plane components will start properly.

```
curl -L https://github.com/codefresh-io/k8s-single-node-installer/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xvz
cd k8s-single-node-installer-master
sudo chmod +x installer
sudo ./installer
```

You can check the progress with `docker ps` and `journal -fu kubelet` commands.

# Development

For testing and development purposes, first run the relevant Vagrant machine:

```
export VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=vagrant/Vagrantfile.ubuntu16
vagrant up
```

This will start a machine that match one of the supported OS and install a
Docker daemon into it.

When vagrant will finish provisioning the machine, ssh into it with `vagrant
ssh` and run:

```
sudo ./installer
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf 
sudo -E ./cf-helm
```

**IMPORTANT** make sure that you have filled in the secrets in `values.yml`
 file before running the `cf-helm` command.
